# BreakoutGame
A Breakout game written in Assembly.
A Breakout game is a classic arcade game where the main objective is to destroy a wall of bricks at the top of the screen by bouncing a ball off a paddle that the player can move horizontally. Here's how you play:

1. Start: The game begins with three lives. A single ball bounces around the screen, and the player moves a horizontal paddle back and forth under the bricks to bounce the ball.

2. Bricks: The top part of the screen is filled with a grid of bricks. Each brick has three hits it can withstand before breaking.

3. Paddle: The paddle is controlled by the player and can be moved left or right along the bottom of the screen. The ball must be bounced off the paddle to keep it in play.

4. Ball: The ball bounces around the screen, and its speed increases as the game progresses. If the ball hits a brick, the brick is destroyed (or weakened) and the ball continues bouncing.

5. Lives: If the ball hits the bottom of the screen, the player loses a life. When all lives are lost, the game is over.

6. Time limit: If the game doesn't end in a certain amount of time, the game will end automatically.

7. The goal is to clear all the bricks from each level without running out of lives. The game ends when all levels are completed or when the player runs out of lives.

用汇编语言编写的弹球游戏。
弹球游戏是一款经典街机游戏，主要目标是通过让球在屏幕顶部的砖墙与玩家可以水平移动的挡板之间弹跳，来摧毁这堵砖墙。以下是游戏的玩法：

1. 开始：游戏开始时有三条生命。一个球在屏幕上弹跳，玩家在砖墙下方水平来回移动挡板，使球能够反弹。

2. 砖块：屏幕的上部布满了一排排的砖块。每个砖块能承受三次撞击后才会被摧毁。

3. 挡板：挡板由玩家控制，可以在屏幕底部左右移动。球必须在挡板上弹跳才能保持游戏进行。

4. 球：球在屏幕上弹跳，随着游戏的进行，其速度会逐渐加快。如果球击中砖块，砖块会被摧毁（或削弱），球则继续弹跳。

5. 生命值：如果球触碰到底部边缘，玩家将失去一条生命。当所有生命值耗尽，游戏结束。

6. 时间限制：如果游戏没有在规定时间内结束，游戏将自动结束。

7. 目标是清除每一关的所有砖块而不耗尽生命值。当所有关卡都被完成，或玩家的生命值耗尽时，游戏结束。
